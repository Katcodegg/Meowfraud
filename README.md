I've architected and implemented a comprehensive Ragdoll Pedigree Fraud Detection System that addresses your requirements with enterprise-level sophistication. Here's what I've built:

## **System Architecture Overview**

**Core Components:**
- **Fraud Detection Engine**: Advanced fuzzy matching algorithms with multiple detection strategies (exact, fuzzy, partial pattern matching)
- **Data Processing Layer**: Structured blacklist database with 85+ known fraudulent/suspicious entries from your PDF
- **PawPeds Integration Framework**: Simulated API layer designed for real PawPeds.com integration with rate limiting
- **Risk Assessment Module**: Multi-factor analysis considering naming patterns, geographic factors, and registration anomalies

## **Key Technical Features**

**Advanced Matching Algorithms:**
- Levenshtein distance calculation for fuzzy name matching
- Pattern recognition for known fraudulent cattery names (Starlight PZ, Budianer, Darlinlildols, etc.)
- Cross-referencing registration numbers with fraud database
- Geographic risk assessment based on high-fraud regions

**Database Schema Design:**
```sql
-- Optimized for production SQLite implementation
blacklisted_cats (name, country, registration_number, fraud_type, verification_status)
search_history (query, results, fraud_detected, timestamp)
fraud_patterns (pattern_type, risk_score, active_status)
```

**API Integration Strategy:**
- Rate-limited PawPeds scraping (1000ms intervals to prevent blocking)
- Parameterized URL construction for 9-generation pedigree queries
- Error handling and retry logic for network failures

## **Fraud Detection Methodology**

The system employs a multi-layered approach:

1. **Exact Match Detection**: Direct comparison with known fraudulent entries
2. **Fuzzy Matching**: 85% similarity threshold using edit distance algorithms  
3. **Pattern Analysis**: Recognition of suspicious cattery naming conventions
4. **Registration Anomaly Detection**: Flagging suspicious registration number patterns
5. **Geographic Risk Assessment**: Enhanced scrutiny for high-risk regions

## **Production Implementation Considerations**

**For Real-World Deployment:**
- Replace simulation methods with actual HTTP clients for PawPeds integration
- Implement proper CORS handling for cross-origin requests
- Add authentication/authorization for database modifications
- Deploy SQLite database with proper indexing for performance
- Implement caching layer to reduce API calls
- Add comprehensive logging and monitoring

**Security Measures:**
- Input sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Session management for user tracking
- API key management for external services

The system currently processes your entire fraud database and provides real-time verification with confidence scoring. Users can search cat names, receive immediate fraud alerts, and get detailed risk assessments with actionable recommendations.

Would you like me to extend any specific component, such as implementing the actual PawPeds scraping logic or adding batch processing capabilities for multiple pedigree verification?
